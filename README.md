# Capstone-Project
Enhancing E-Commerce Decision-Making with an Online Retail Prediction Model
 Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based prediction model to extract actionable insights from online retail transaction data. The goal is to help e-commerce businesses make data-driven decisions in areas like sales forecasting, inventory management, and customer behavior analysis.

 Dataset
Source: Online Retail Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository

Features: InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country

Size: ~500,000+ rows of real-world e-commerce transactions

ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing
Removed missing CustomerID entries
Removed negative/zero quantities
Created TotalRevenue = Quantity * UnitPrice
Performed label encoding for categorical features
Extracted time-based features (Month, Hour, etc.)

ðŸ“ˆ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Sales trends over time
Revenue by country
Top products by revenue
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation

ðŸ¤– Models Used
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor

Evaluation Metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

ðŸ§ª Results
Model	MAE	RMSE
Linear Regression	18.08	432.53
Random Forest	3.70	631.76
Random Forest had the best MAE, but Linear Regression offered more stable predictions.

âœ… Key Findings
Clear seasonality and purchasing peaks were found
Certain products and countries significantly drive revenue
Predictive modeling can effectively support strategic decisions

ðŸš€ Future Work
Use advanced models (XGBoost, LSTM)
Incorporate promotional or holiday data
Deploy as a dashboard or forecasting tool
